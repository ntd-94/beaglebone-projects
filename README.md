# **Learning embedded linux with the Beaglebone Black**

### **Development Board**: [Beaglebone Black](http://beagleboard.org/black)

### **Operating system**: [Arch Linux ARM](https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv7/ti/beaglebone-black)

### **Goals**:

- [x] Get Arch Linux wokring on eMMC
   - SSH working
   - Wifi working
- [x] Learn embedded Linux GPIO filesystem
- [x] Learn basics of Device Tree Overlays (DTOs) and how to compile them
- [x] Learn Analog input(ADC) and output(DAC), PWM setup guide in useful-documents
- [ ] Learn various bus communications
    - I2C, SPI, UART
- [ ] Learn to interface with DC motors and other physical components
- [ ] Get very basic high performance GUI working (XFCE?)
- [ ] Get some kind of audio output and input(for later on voice commands) working
- [ ] Learn OpenCV using C++ to get some sort of machine vision working with a webcam
- [ ] Learn more about DTOs
- [ ] Write more advanced C programs to interface with GPIOs and Analog IO

### **Final Goal**:
I want to use the Beaglebone for robotics projects in the future.
